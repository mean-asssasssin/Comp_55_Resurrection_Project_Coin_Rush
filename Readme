In this attempt I created a file reader that take levels that are stored in files and allows for them to be read.
only one level form the oringals are finished But the others can be added once i create the text files for them.
The plan to impilment them has changed twice as the first thing i tried was to make a file reader than just have it run off that data with old code
I had to change that plan to make a new level loader and base level which basically just is able to create any level given its data
I also had to make data files that just hold data for the other contructors this helps trouble shoot as I can see it in the errors of the code
which data isnt being sent. These text files have a defined structure so that they can be read the correct way.
currently the pause button doesnt work as in creating a new main appication process has changed how to add it
It will be easy to add the function back in but for now I will just create levels and store its data in text files
the index for levels has to be hand added but instead of creating a new class you can simply just create a text file.
this improves the overall creations of levels.
I currently do not have a end of levels command/ check that will be one thing to add so that the player doesnt click play next level when there is no level
This is just because I do not know how many level I will be adding in the new world as said in one of my issues.
